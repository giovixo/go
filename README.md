# go
A simple python script to go in a given directory.

## Usage
Set your path in 'go.py' file, edit preferences in 'dir.yaml', and 'python go.py'.

Depending on your shell, maybe you need to change the following lines:

```
os.system('zsh')
os.system('source .zshrc')
```

> It seems that these awful two lines are mandatory. If you have a solution, do not forget to open an issue.

The pyYAML module is required
